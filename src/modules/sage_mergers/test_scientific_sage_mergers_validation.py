Scientific validation tests for SAGE mergers module.

PLACEHOLDER: Full tests deferred until core integration and full SAGE physics pipeline.

These tests will validate:
- Merger rates (major/minor/disruption statistics)
- Mass conservation through full pipeline
- Morphological mix (disk vs. bulge fractions)
- Black hole mass functions
- Comparison to SAGE reference outputs
