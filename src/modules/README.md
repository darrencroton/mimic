# Physics Modules

**Purpose:** Runtime-loadable galaxy physics modules.

**Current:** Empty (awaiting Phase 1 implementation of module system)

**Note:** Halo physics (virial calculations, tracking) are in `src/core/halo_properties/` as they are core infrastructure, not modular physics.

**Future:** This directory will contain galaxy physics modules (cooling, star formation, feedback, etc.) once the module system is implemented. See `docs/architecture/roadmap_v3.md` for details.
